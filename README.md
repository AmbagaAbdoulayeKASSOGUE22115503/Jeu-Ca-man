# Jeu-Caiman
Welcome to Ca誰man, a simple yet engaging board game implemented in Python! In Ca誰man, players navigate a board with three pawns: one yellow, one black, and one red. The objective is straightforward: outmaneuver your opponent, whether it's the computer or another player, to be the last pawn standing or force your opponent to surrender.

Each pawn has a different value: yellow pawns are worth 1 point, red pawns 2 points, and black pawns 3 points. The game continues until only one pawn remains on the board or when a player decides to concede defeat.

Players have the choice to challenge the computer or play against another player. With simple Python code leveraging basic concepts, Ca誰man offers an accessible and enjoyable gaming experience without the need for complex libraries or advanced programming knowledge.

Get ready to strategize, anticipate your opponent's moves, and claim victory in Ca誰man!
